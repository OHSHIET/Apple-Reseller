# Apple Reseller webpage
This website was created as a final project for the web design course at Singidunum University.

## About the website
jQuery, Bootstrap, Popper.js and Swiper for sliders were used for this site. For the random cat fact I used [this site](https://catfact.ninja/).

## Rules for the website (provided by the professors)
Students can choose site topic on their own, and should collect all necessary
materials themselves.
Topics could be: computer shop, website of tourist organization, newspaper
blog (sport, news etc.), website about movies, games or movies.
Students can decide on their own number of pages, content, design, navigation
and functionality. Studets should create minimum five pages at least (for
example: home, about, portfolio, gallery/activity/videos, contact with some
form)

During web site implementation, it is necessary to pay attention to the
following:
- Site topic
- Site organization (CSS3)
- Navigation
- Font-size
- Images
You can use:
 1.) https://pixabay.com/
 2.) https://unsplash.com/
 3.) https://www.pexels.com/
 
- Number of pages and connections between them (at least five pages -
home, about, contact, one page with form)
- CSS3 must be used for design (you can use Bootstrap, Google Material
or any other frameworks)
- JavaScript must be used for adding interactivity (sliders, animations
etc.)
- One page must contain form (for example, ordering some products,
ordering flight tickets, or similar, with full JavaScript validation
of user input, but not the same as the example which is covered during
classes)
- At least one Ajax call to external API (any open API can be used, for
example to get weather forecast, movies, sports etc.).
- About page is mandatory, should point to the page where basic
information about student is listed.
